      <p>Discretization plays an important part in coupled Oil & Gas basin modelling. Too fine, the computation time
        prevails, too coarse and the calculations do not converge. As a software integration engineer I implemented an
        interface with the RINGMesh library to dynamically re-mesh during simulations.</p>

      <p>I pride myself on thinking laterally and outside of the box to provide novel innovative solutions, drawing on
        insights from both my geological and software engineering backgrounds.
        The role permitted vast exposure to the company and clients. Regular client meetings and presentations were held
        as well as working, and leading, interdisciplinary initiatives.
        Seequent are the developers of the Leapfrog Suite, a world standard for 3D implicit geological modelling
        software. Daily use and technical insights led me to become an expert user, continuously pushing the limits.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>New Technologies</b> Some problems call for thinking outside the box and implementing new technologies from the
          base up. Examples of these projects included web based dashboard creation, integration of Jupyter into
          workflows and deploying compute intensive tasks to the cloud.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>New Solutions</b> Other projects included the reuse of core IP in novel manners. For example the auto- mated
          creation of geological models from sub sets of data to sample geological uncertainty. This work was presented
          at Seequent’s Perth Lyceum.

        <li>
          <b>Core Strategy</b> Providing technical support for key business decisions including full verification of geo-
          statistical implementations and creation of infrastructure to obtain and analyse usage metrics of Leapfrog
          software.

      <p>Climate Simulations pose multiple technical problems from the setting up boundary of conditions to the interpretation of results.</p>
      <p>
        As part of the paleo-climate team I lead the development of an open source interactive web based tool to setup boundary conditions for the IPSL model. Relying on a micro-service architecture and messaging queues, complex compute is carried in multiple languages in different containers. The tool is used by the greater climate community for the ability to interactively edit NetCDF files.

      <p>
        Often simulation results are too large to manage on a local machine. I deployed and maintain the Jupyter-Hub server for the group providing team members with a unified functional development environment and suﬀicient compute resources.
        In a research environment outreach is crucial, to that end I designed and deployed the teams web portal.
